# Graph Data Element


This code snippet is a comprehensive example of creating a 3D force-directed graph using several JavaScript libraries and custom components. Here's a breakdown and explanation of its main parts:

### Imports and Dependencies
- **THREE.js**: Imported from `./vendor/three.module.js`, it's a popular library for creating and displaying animated 3D graphics in a web browser.
- **3D Force Graph**: Imported from `./vendor/3d-force-graph.min.js`, this is likely a library that specializes in rendering 3D force-directed graphs.
- **CSS2DRenderer**: Imported from `./vendor/CSS2DRenderer.js`, it allows for rendering 2D elements (like labels) in a 3D scene using CSS, which is part of THREE.js extras.
- **DataroomElement**: Imported from `./dataroom-element.js`, this seems to be a custom element, possibly extending `HTMLElement`, specific to the application's context.

### Utility Function: `parseTextToJSON`
This function parses a given input text into a JSON object that contains nodes and links between them. The input text format is expected to have lines with source and target node names enclosed in square brackets. The function ensures no duplicate nodes are added.

### Class: `ForceGraphComponent`
This class extends `DataroomElement` and is responsible for creating a 3D force-directed graph.

#### Key Methods and Properties:
- **drawOverlay**: A method to display an overlay with information about a node. Currently, it's prepared but not used actively in the provided methods.
- **focusOnNode**: Adjusts the camera position to focus on a given node, smoothly transitioning to the new position.
- **initialize**: Prepares the graph by configuring styles, dimensions, and graph data. It uses `parseTextToJSON` to convert the inner text of the element into graph data and sets up the 3D graph with various properties such as background color, link color, and node objects. It also defines interactions such as what happens on a node click.
- **observedAttributes, attributeChangedCallback**: Placeholder methods for attribute changes. Currently, they are not actively used but are part of the custom element lifecycle hooks.

### 3D Graph Configuration
The `initialize` method sets up the 3D force graph with custom rendering for nodes using THREE.js objects and CSS2DRenderer for labels. It also configures interactions like focusing on a node upon clicking.

### Integration and Custom Elements
The class is registered as a custom element `graph-data`, allowing it to be used as a tag (`<graph-data></graph-data>`) within HTML. This approach encapsulates the functionality and makes the component reusable.

### Summary
This code is a sophisticated example of integrating 3D graphics, custom web components, and data visualization in a web application. It showcases the use of modern JavaScript libraries and custom elements to create interactive and visually appealing 3D force-directed graphs.
